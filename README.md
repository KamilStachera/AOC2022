# ADVENT OF CODE 2022

## BEWARE! THIS CODE IS HIGHLY OPTIMIZED FOR SEMICOLONS COUNT (as low value as possible)
but this doen't mean that I endorse such linq usage (duh, I even hate this type of "smart programming" in real code bases) but for 'training' purposes I wanted to embrace this kid of challenge 

### Semicolon counts for all the tasks:

| Day | First Task | Second Task |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 1 | 1|
| 2 | 1 | tbd|
| 3 | - | - |
