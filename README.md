# ADVENT OF CODE 2022

## BEWARE! THIS CODE IS HIGHLY OPTIMIZED FOR SEMICOLONS COUNT (as low value as possible)
but this doen't mean that I endorse such linq usage (duh, I even hate this type of "smart programming" in real code bases) but for 'training' purposes I wanted to embrace this kid of challenge 

### Semicolon counts for all the tasks:

| Day | First Task | Second Task |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 1 | 1|
| 2 | 1 | tbd|
| 3 | - | - |
| 4 | - | - |
| 5 | - | - |
| 6 | - | - |
| 7 | - | - |
| 8 | - | - |
| 9 | - | - |
| 10 | - | - |
| 11 | - | - |
| 12 | - | - |
| 13 | - | - |
| 14 | - | - |
| 15 | - | - |
| 16 | - | - |
| 17 | - | - |
| 18 | - | - |
| 19 | - | - |
| 20 | - | - |
| 21 | - | - |
| 22 | - | - |
| 23 | - | - |
